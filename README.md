# ☁️ YugCast

# Hi there! 👋 I'm Yugank Rai

I'm a passionate **Computer Science Engineering student** at **IIIT Bhagalpur** and a dedicated learner.

While my other repositories track my coding journey, **YugCast** is where I put that knowledge into action. This is a fully functional **Weather Dashboard** built to master API integration and asynchronous JavaScript.

🌱 **My Goal:** To move beyond basic syntax and build applications that interact with the real world using live data.

## 🚀 About The Project

**YugCast** is a responsive web application that provides real-time weather updates for any city in the world. It connects to the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch live data including temperature, humidity, and wind conditions.

### ✨ Key Features

* **Live Search:** Instantly find weather data for any global city.
* **Dynamic UI:** The interface updates instantly without reloading the page.
* **Error Handling:** Displays user-friendly messages if a city isn't found.
* **Responsive Design:** Optimized for both desktop and mobile screens.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Learnings

This project was built to solidify my understanding of the following concepts:

* **JavaScript (ES6+):** Used `async/await` and `fetch()` to handle API promises cleanly.
* **DOM Manipulation:** Dynamically injecting HTML based on JSON data responses.
* **CSS3:** Using Flexbox for alignment and media queries for responsiveness.
* **API Integration:** Handling keys, query parameters, and JSON parsing.
